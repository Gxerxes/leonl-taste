v2.0.0

	* jQuery is now provided by only one template. This template normalizes how
	  modules built with it are used in CommonJS environments:

			require('./myJqueryPlugin')(window, [jQuery]);


		Providing window is mandated. This is because jQuery upstream,

			1. Sometimes returns a factory, and only sometimes.
			2. We *always* have access to window.
			3. It makes the use of window explicit.
			4. If jQuery ever provides access to the factory we are forward-compatable.
